  Hi, my name is Roberto De Filippo, I am a neuroscientist interested in neuromodulation and sensory perception. 
  Currently my main focus is <mark>serotonin</mark>, in vivo recording with high-density probes (Neuropixel) and Machine Learning in the context of neural decoding.
  I have experience working with:
  <mark>Python</mark>,
  <mark>Tensorflow</mark>,
  <mark>Matlab</mark>,
  <mark>Max/MSP</mark>,
  <mark>Pure Data</mark> and
  <mark>git</mark>.

            My PhD project is focused on serotonergic modulation of slow oscillations in entorhinal cortex, it led to the publication 
            "Somatostatin interneurons activated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor suppress slow oscillations in medial entorhinal cortex (Elife, 2021)". 
            We identified a novel mechanism by which serotonin is able to alter cortical network activity. During the course of this project I employed the following techniques: 
            in vitro patch clamp, silicone probe recording in anesthetized mice, optogenetics, 
            pharmacology, immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
